### Custom domain: fredheimlogistics.com

The `CNAME` file in this repo points GitHub Pages at `fredheimlogistics.com`.
At your domain registrar's DNS settings, add:

| Type  | Host / Name | Value                       |
| ----- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| A     | `@`         | `185.199.108.153`           |
| A     | `@`         | `185.199.109.153`           |
| A     | `@`         | `185.199.110.153`           |
| A     | `@`         | `185.199.111.153`           |
| CNAME | `www`       | `fknutsen-web.github.io.`   |

Then in **Settings → Pages**, set the custom domain to `fredheimlogistics.com`
and enable **Enforce HTTPS** once the certificate is issued.

## Before going live

- Replace the placeholder email `contact@fredheim.com` (appears in the nav, contact
  link, and form handler).
- The contact form opens the visitor’s mail client (no backend). For real lead
  capture, wire it to Formspree, a Netlify form, or a serverless function.
- Add analytics, favicon, and Open Graph / meta tags as needed.

## Files

- `index.html` — the site (served at the root by GitHub Pages)
- `fredheim.html` — identical copy under the original filename
